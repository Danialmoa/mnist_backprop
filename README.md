# MNIST Digit Recognition from Scratch

This project is developed as part of the Machine Learning course at the University of Siena. It implements a neural network from scratch using NumPy to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:
1. A neural network implementation trained on the MNIST dataset
2. An interactive interface for real-world digit recognition

## Key Files

- `backPropMNIST.py`: Contains the main neural network implementation and training code
- `digitalRecogniser.py`: Provides an interactive interface where users can draw digits and get real-time predictions

## Features

- Neural network implemented from scratch using only NumPy
- Trained on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits
- Interactive drawing interface for testing the model
- Real-time digit prediction

## Usage

1. Training the model:
    python backPropMNIST.py
2. Testing with the interactive interface:
    python digitalRecogniser.py

##  Download the MNIST dataset
./start.sh
